        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a freelance developer based in North East England, with a passion for cutting-edge technologies and artificial intelligence. Before moving to the UK in 2022 I have been working in Hong Kong as an enterprise software developer for almost 10 years. With experience in working with ChatGPT/GPT-4, I strive to create innovative solutions for clients and am always eager to explore new advancements in AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            While AI-generated code has immense potential, I firmly believe that a human touch is essential to ensure the highest quality of work. Current AI technology has its limitations, and as an experienced developer, I am committed to bridging the gap between AI and human expertise to deliver the best possible results for your projects.

        <h2>The Human Touch: Why You Need It Even with AI Code Generation</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence, particularly large language models like ChatGPT, has made significant advancements in recent years. However, there are still crucial areas where human expertise outshines AI capabilities, especially when it comes to software development. Here are a few reasons why you need a human touch in your projects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>General-purpose vs. business-specific:</strong> LLMs such as ChatGPT are designed for general-purpose use and may not fully understand your specific business or sector needs. A human developer can grasp your unique requirements and tailor solutions accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Code architecture and quality:</strong> While AI can generate code, it is not yet capable of designing efficient and maintainable code architecture. A human developer can ensure optimal performance, maintainability, and scalability for your projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Complex problem-solving:</strong> LLMs have limitations in addressing complex, business-specific production issues. A human developer, who knows the entire business logic flow, can diagnose and solve issues more effectively than AI constrained by context length limits.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Human intuition and creativity:</strong> AI models may lack the intuition and creativity that human developers possess. A human touch can bring innovative ideas and unique problem-solving approaches, which are essential for successful and competitive software development.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Communication and collaboration:</strong> Effective communication and collaboration are vital in software development projects. A human developer can better understand your feedback, adapt to changes, and work seamlessly with your team to achieve the desired outcomes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By combining the power of AI with human expertise, you can ensure the success of your projects while leveraging the advantages of both worlds. Choose a freelance developer who values the human touch and can bring your vision to life.
